    # Naming your medication

    Enter in a *short* memorable name for your medication.

    Feel free to shorten the text the search box inserted for you if you selected one from the list that shows up after you start typing. Selecting an item from that list will also insert starting values in the quantity and unit fields.
    """
  static let unitHelpText =
  """
    # Describing a "Unit"

    Describe what a *single* pill looks like. You will input quantity later.

    For example, if you take two orange 200mg pills every six hours, put "**200mg orange pill**" here.

    ### Other Examples:

     - 40mg Square Blue Pill
     - 100mg Capsule

    *****

    # Things that aren't pills

    Some types of medications do not come as pills.

     - For prepackaged, single-use items, put "**kit**" here.
     - If your medication is something liquid or powdered, put "**g**" or "**ml**" or whatever unit measurement uses.
     - If your medication is in an inhaler, put **puff** here.
    """

  static let quantityHelpText =
  """
    # Quantity

    For most medications, this is the number of pills you take at once.

    For example, if you take two 200mg pills every six hours, you put "**2**" here, as that's how much you take at a single time.

    If you take a liquid, take how many "units" of that medication you take. So if you take 10ml of a tylenol solution, put "**10**" here.

    # Prescriber

    This is the person who wrote your prescription. They are typically a doctor or nurse practitioner. This will be on the medication bottle and prescription.

    # Describe when you take it

    Start typing how and when you need to take the medication. We will show you some patterns of possible matchups that fit common times of day that people use to remember to take their medications.

    You can select any of those shown as you type, or tap "Custom" to build your own.

    # Who Fills this Prescription

    # Condition

    Write what condition or impairment that motivates you to take this medication. This helps you discuss your entire treatment plan with every doctor trying to help you.

    This also helps you clean up after recovering from something like a surgery or other intermittant occasion where you will not need many of the medications long term.
